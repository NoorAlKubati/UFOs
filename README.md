# UFOs
## Project Overview
In this project, I created a table that displays a data from a JS file. After that, a set of four filters, namely date, city, state, country, and shape, are utilized to filter the data simultaneously. This project was done using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. When the user puts any text into the text boxes used for data filtering, the content of the table adjusts automatically.

## Results
The end result of this project is really satisfying and very useful. The huge dataset that is initially displayed is now more managable thanks to the filter functions. For example, you could type in "KS" in the state text button, and only the UFO sightings in Kansas will show instantaneously. So instead of sieving through hundreds of records, this filter function makes it really easy to manage the data.

## Summary
Overall, this web page demonstrates a good functionality of using JavaScript to add a dynamic feel to HTML content. Additionally, change in the content is completely instantaneous and quick to display. However, there is one possible drawback to this web page, which is the fact that filter content has to be exact to the data. For Example, if you type"KS" is upper case, the filter will not show any results.
